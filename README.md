Ruby Beautifier
===============

Trying to keep this nice ruby beautifier tool (from way back) up to date.

It will format ruby files to make them look good indentation wise, etc.  It's
kind of like go format, but for ruby (though it does not parse the program
in).

If you find some code that this beautifier cannot handle, please send it our
way by way of a bug or better yet a pull request.
